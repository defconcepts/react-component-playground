Reactjs Component Playground
============================

A place where you can design with existing react components by drag and drop and other not programmatic ways.

The question to answer is - Can we use immutable data structures and react's rerender logic to build a photoshop like thing, but for react components only?

How to try it out - 

`npm install`
`gulp`

Go to the browser - `localhost:8000`
